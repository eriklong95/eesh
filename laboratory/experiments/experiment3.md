# Experiment #3: Executing programs in a process

What happens at the call to `execvp()`?
Will the print statement after the `execvp` call be executed?

## What if ...

make the child process execute other programs: `ls -l`

Can the child process call the program that the parent process runs
write print statements so you can observe what happens

Can the child process kill the parent process?
