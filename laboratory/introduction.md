# Welcome to the Laboratory!

This is the place for exploring UNIX system calls
through experiments.

To learn and increase your knowledge, carry out some experiments.

If you need it along the way, it is possible to get help.

When you have gained experience, you may want to take
on the challenge of working on a real project that uses
UNIX system calls.
