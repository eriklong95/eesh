# Welcome to the Laboratory!

This is the place for exploring UNIX system calls
through experiments.

To learn and increase your knowledge, carry out some [experiments](experiments/index.md).

If you need it along the way, it is possible to get 
[help](help/compile-and-run.md).

When you have gained experience, you may want to take
on the challenge of working on a real
[project](project/eesh.md) that uses
UNIX system calls.
